# Prologue

_The **Binary Options Settlement Protocol**,_ [_BIOPset_](https://biopset.com/)_, is an audited, on-demand, censorship-resistant, peer-to-pool protocol for decentralized binary options trading._ 

_The platform essentially provides liquidity providers \("**options writers**"\) with passive returns and  empowers speculative traders \("**options holders**"\) to profit from forecasting the direction of asset prices._ 

_The protocol is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization \("**DAO**"\) called the **Settlement DAO**._
