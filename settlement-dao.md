# Settlement DAO

_The Binary Options Settlement Protocol \("**BIOPset**"\) is governed by the Settlement DAO._

## Governance Overview

The Settlement DAO governs through a liquid democracy of BIOP token holders.

Governors vote on formalized initiatives that bubble up from community discussions on Discord to the BIOPset forum. Formalized initiatives are put to a vote on BIOPset [Snapshot Page](https://snapshot.org/#/biopset.eth).

## Governance Process

The governance process of the Settlement DAO is outlined below:

### Discussion

Ideas for improving BIOPset are discussed in [Discord](https://discord.gg/4SRYBNdE3r).

### Proposals

Meritorious ideas are then outlined in official proposals in the [BIOPset forum](https://biopset.freeforums.net).

### Voting

After discussion has been exhausted via the forum, holders of the BIOP Governance Token may then vote on the official proposal via the [Snapshot Page](https://snapshot.org/#/biopset.eth).
