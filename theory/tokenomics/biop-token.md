# $BIOP Token

BIOP tokens are used for governing the BIOPset protocol.
A total of approximately 31 Million $BIOP tokens will be issued. $BIOP tokens are standard ERC-20 tokens and use the ticker BIOP.

The majority of BIOP tokens \(45.2%\) are allocated to reward platform utilization. For a more detailed breakdown, see the "token distribution" section below.

### Utilization Rewards

The majority \(45.2%\) of $BIOP will be distributed to community members via an **transaction mining** mechanism. Transaction mining is the process of rewarding platform participants. Thus these rewards may also be called transaction mining rewards.
Of these tokens, 10% will be unlocked at Token Generation Event, with a following vesting of 3.125% per month over the following 

Transaction mining activities commenced with the BIOPset V1 Mainnet launch. Please see the [Benefits](https://munair.gitbook.io/biopset/theory/overview/benefits) section for more information.

### Bonding Curve

The Bonding Curve will be deployed by the DAO in the case of lackluster liquidity on dexes. The swap fee of the Bonding Curve will go to the BIOPset Treasury.
The tokens will be locked until 6 months from launch, when the ability to deploy the Bonding Curve will be transferred to the DAO
Please see [Bonding Curve](https://docs.biopset.com/references/tokens/boding-curve) for further details.

### Initial Tiered Coins Offering

The initial funds for development and a bootstrap to the BIOPset Liquidity will be done through the ITCO (Initial Tiered Coins Offering).
For more details about the [ITCO](https://docs.biopset.com/references/tokens/itco).

### Dex Rewards

To incentivise Uniswap liquidity we will provide incentives to the Uniswap Liquidity Providers that will stake their LP tokens.

### Developer Fund

The Developer Fund will be used to pay for development, deployment, grants and to prevent DAO attacks until a healthy organization is present.
Of the developer fund 25% will be dedicated to the original team members with a 10% unlock at TGE and a linear unlock over 3 years.
The other 75% will be transferred to the DAO after its launch.

### Uniswap Listing

To provide a starting price and enable trading on Uniswap the team will lock BIOP and Ethereum in a Uniswap Liquidity Pool after the ITCO end

### V2/V3 Repayment

During BIOPset V2 and BIOPset V3, the betters won over the entire liquidity pool. A lot of measures are now in place to avoid that it will happen again.
To repay those who lost their Ethereum because of those reasons, we will reward them with an amount of BIOP equal to the ETH they lost, at a rate of ~0.0001 ETH / BIOP.

### Airdrops

To incentivize the community to actively partecipate and grow we are planning multiple airdrop and events with BIOP prizes

### V2/V3 Swap

The users that partecipated in transaction mining on the previous biop versions and got old versions of the BIOP token will receive the new BIOP v4
