# Summary

_BIOPset is the world's first on-demand, peer-to-pool, decentralized binary options trading protocol. It is built on the Ethereum Network to ensure censorship-resistance and governed by BIOP tokens in the Settlement DAO._

[_Shalaquiana_](https://twitter.com/shalaquiana) _is the pseudonymous founder behind the initial version of the BIOPset protocol._

## Stakeholders

BIOPset caters to the following classes of stakeholders:

1. Traders.
2. Writers.
3. Settlers.
4. Governors.

The first two stakeholders are counterparties to decentralized binary options. The second two stakeholders make and fine tune the execution the protocol.

{% hint style="info" %}
Counterparties take opposing sides of an options contract. It is impossible to buy derivatives \(like binary options\) without a counterparty willing to sell it.
{% endhint %}

Every participant stands to gain something financially for their interaction with the protocol.

### Traders

The purchasers of binary options are called **options traders** \(or just **traders**\) in BIOPset nomenclature. These binary options buyers \(or "**options holders**"\) are actively speculating on the direction of price movements. Traders are the principal users of the BIOPset platform.

{% hint style="info" %}
Traders \(or options buyers\) are active participants in the BIOPset trading protocol.
{% endhint %}

### Writers

The vendors of binary options are called **writers** in BIOPset nomenclature. These binary options sellers \(or "**options writers**"\) are counterparties to binary options buyers.

In BIOPset, writers pool their funds together to function as passive counterparties to traders. They are also called **liquidity providers** \(or **market makers**\).

{% hint style="info" %}
Writers \(or liquidity providers\) are passive users in BIOPset.
{% endhint %}

Although BIOPset's infrastructure primarily provides a service to binary options buyers, it is the passive pool of options sellers that provide the liquidity required for the service to work. They are like vendors that set up a shop and bring a market to life.

### Settlers

Settlers are humans \(or bots\) that facilitate the realization of a gain for either the trader or writer.

They intervene on behalf of the options trader by **settling** in-the-money options. They intervene on behalf of the options writers by **settling** binary options that have become worthless.

### Governors

Anyone holding BIOP tokens is automatically a governor. Governors are responsible for fine tuning BIOPset parameters to ensure a reasonable yield for liquidity providers.

Liquidity providers need not be governors and vice versa.

{% hint style="info" %}
Ideally, governors are also liquidity providers. This aligns shorter-term and longer-term incentive structures.
