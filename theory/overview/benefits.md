description: The benefits of interacting with BIOPset.

# Benefits

_BIOPset provides a **trustless** binary options trading solution for traders \(or **speculators**\). It is the first binary options platform to offer **instant access** and **no holds** on speculator funds. As soon as a trader's options are valuable \(or **in-the-money**\), they \(as an "**interventionist**"\) can exercise their claim and receive ETH directly to their wallet without having to depend or trust a third-party._

{% hint style="info" %}
Options writers with BIOP tokens become investor/owners and act as house. This provides a benefit rarely observed in centralized binary options trading platforms.
{% endhint %}

Every interaction with the BIOPset platform earns BIOP tokens. BIOP rewards may be sold or held for their voting power.

| Action | Launch Rewards \(4x\) | Standard Rewards |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Writing \(over 2 ETH\) | 480 BIOP | 120 BIOP |
| Writing \(under 2 ETH\) | 240 BIOP | 60 BIOP |
| Trading \(any amount\) | 160 BIOP | 40 BIOP |
| Intervening | 8 BIOP | 2 BIOP |

## What's Else Is In It For Me?

Outside of receiving BIOP rewards, every participant stands to gain something financially for their participation in BIOPset. BIOPset ensures that the following four stakeholders are properly recompensed:

1. Traders.
2. Writers.
3. Interventionists.
4. Governors.

Governors always retain the right to determine exactly how each stakeholder is compensated for their activities.

### Traders

Traders \(or **options traders**\) are actively buying binary options. They can potentially double their wealth if they speculate correctly on price direction.

Traders can also be interventionists \(see below\).

### Writers

Writers \(or **options writers**\) are passively selling binary options in a pool with other sellers. They are BIOPset's market makers \(or **liquidity providers**\). Liquidity providers earn very competitive yields for market making \(**options writing**\).

Writers can also be interventionists \(see below\).

### Interventionists

Interventionists receive risk-free fees for providing their services. The amount is 5% of the position size. Consequently, an interventionist can earn $50K USD for exercising/expiring a million dollar position.

{% hint style="info" %}
Interventionist act on behalf of the options trader by **exercising** in-the-money options. They intervene on behalf of the liquidity provider by **expiring** binary options that have become worthless.
{% endhint %}

Anyone \(human, bot, or artificial intelligence\) with a wallet and sufficient gas can be an interventionist.

### Governors

Transaction fees are presently set to 20 basis points \(0.2%\) and governors may elect \(through voting\) to distribute a portion of those fees to token holders willing to stake BIOP tokens.

{% hint style="info" %}
Governors are responsible for fine tuning BIOPset parameters to ensure a reasonable yield for liquidity providers. They are incentivized for ensuring user growth of the platform in the longer-term.
{% endhint %}

Traders, writers, and interventionists can all participate in governance initiatives by holding BIOP tokens. They may also delegate that voting power to any governor that garners their confidence.
