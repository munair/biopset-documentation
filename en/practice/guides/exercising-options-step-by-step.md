# Settling Options Step-By-Step

After expiration, a trader's binary options are either valuable \(**in-the-money** or **ITM**\) or worthless \(**out-of-the money** or **OTM**\). Settlement is the process of transferring funds to the trader if the options are ITM, or the writer \(liquidity pool\) if the options are OTM. This is how to settle options, step-by-step:

## Step 1: Exercise Valuable Options

**Want to claim the 0.2% settlement fee for yourself?** visit the "**Settle**" page and claim the entire value of the option for yourself.

While your there you can help others \(and **earn a risk free fee for yourself**\) by settling other ITM or OTM options

Even if your option choice is wrong you can get some of your money back by expiring it.
