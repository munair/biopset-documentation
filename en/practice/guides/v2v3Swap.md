# Swapping v2 to v3 BIOP tokens

## Step 1: Visit [BIOPset](https://biopset.com/)

Enter the [https://biopset.com/](https://biopset.com/) URL into your browser. Connect your wallet you used for BIOPset v2.

## Step 2: Confirm the pop up to begin the swap

{% hint style="info" %}
The window will pop up automatically if your address has v2 tokens. If it doesn't show up, restart your browser.
{% endhint %}


## Step 3: Approve the v3 contract to spend your v2 BIOP

The first transaction you will be asked to confirm allows v3 to access your v2 tokens

## Step 4: Make the swap

The second transaction will swap your v2 tokens to v3 tokens. After this transaction completes your all done!

If you have to restart the process part way through, that's ok, the system will detect you've already approved v3 and skip straight to the second transaction.
