# Buying Options Step-By-Step

## Step 1: Visit [BIOPset](https://biopset.com/)

Enter the [https://biopset.com/](https://biopset.com/) URL into your browser.

## Step 2: Connect Your Wallet

Connect your wallet by pressing the “Connect” button. Choose your provider.

## Step 3: Set Option Size

Enter the amount of ETH you want to risk in the red box. It must be less than the amount shown next to “max bet size”.

The amount you can win by picking the direction correctly is shown in the blue box under “WIN”. If your bet is too big you will be shown a message here. ![2](https://github.com/BIOPset/gitbook/raw/main/2.png)

_Your maximum earnings are on the right in the blue box_

As you can see there are other options you can configure like the length of your option \(1 hour in the image above\) and the price pair you want to play on \(ETH/USD in the example above\).

The defaults for these settings make it easy to get started and you can dig in and find the best combo for you later on.

## Step 4: Pick A Direction

Press the blue “UP” button or the red “DOWN” button to select the direction of your option.

If you pick up and the price goes up in the timeframe, you win. If it goes down, you lose.

## Step 5: Confirm the transaction

confirm the transaction in your wallet. \(Shown here in metamask\).

Don’t send the transaction if your wallet tells you there is an error.

_Trading sizes larger than the gas fee are recommended._

Once you’ve confirmed the transaction you have two choices:

1. You can sit back and watch for the next dip to buy at.
2. You can visit the Exercise/Expire page to complete your option.

If you don’t want to have to watch your option for the next hour that’s ok. Anyone will be able to complete it for you and they will get a small fee \(~0.02% of your profits\).
