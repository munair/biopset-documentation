## Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

Choose your provider.

## Step 2: Open Earn Dialog

Once your wallet is connected, click on "**Earn**" in the menu at the top of the screen. This action opens a page for writers to provide liquidity.

When you stake funds you will receive a message explaining the current lockup period. Don't worry, if you need to access your funds before the period is complete you can, but pay a small fee\(1% by default, distributed to everyone else in the pool proportionately\) for leaving the other LPs hanging. See [here](https://docs.biopset.com/theory/fundamentals/selling-options#liquidity-locking) for more information on early withdraw fees.
