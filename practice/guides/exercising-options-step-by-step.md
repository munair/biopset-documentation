# Exercising Options Step-By-Step

Traders binary options are not exercised valuable \(or **in-the-money**\) until an intervention transaction takes place. This is how to intervene, step-by-step:

### Step 1: Exercise Valuable Options

**Want to claim the 0.2% intervention fee for yourself?** visit the Exercise/Expire page and keep your mouse ready to click. The page updates automatically and as soon as your option is ITM\(in the money\) you can click “exercise” and claim the profits all for yourself.

While your there you can help others \(and **earn a risk free fee for yourself**\) by exercising other options ITM and expiring options that didn’t hit their conditions in the timeframe.

Even if your option choice is wrong you can get some of your money back by expiring it.
