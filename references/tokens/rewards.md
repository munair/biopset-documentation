# Rewards

Incentivizing early adoption and transitioning to a successful decentralized governance system are the goals of BIOPset's utilization rewards initiative.

## Utilization Rewards In Brief

Every interaction with the BIOPset platform earns BIOP tokens. BIOP rewards may be sold or held or delegated for their voting power.

{% hint style="info" %}
In BIOP V2, utilization rewards were automatically issued. However, in BIOP V4, **utilization rewards must be claimed**.
{% endhint %}

Utilization rewards are quadrupled during the rewards period and are broken down in the table below:

| Action | Epoch 1 Rewards |
| :--- | :--- |
| Writing | 1.8 BIOP per block |
| Trading | 6017 BIOP per day |
| Settling | 2006 BIOP per day |

{% hint style="info" %}
Capturing utilization rewards is also referred to as **transaction mining** in BIOPset documentation.
{% endhint %}

Settling and trading rewards are issued per day. [Read more](https://docs.biopset.com/references/tokens/rewards#trading-utilization-rewards-in-detail).

Writing rewards are issued per block. [Read more](https://docs.biopset.com/references/tokens/rewards#writer-utilization-rewards-in-detail).

## Writer Utilization Rewards In Detail

Providing liquidity \(or **contributing** or **writing**\) to the pool is heavily incentivized. Writing utilization rewards are structured so that writers receive more BIOP over time depending on the amount of liquidity staked.

The reward is calculated by the number of time the contribution has been staked in the pool, weighted by their size in percentage of the entire pool.

## Trading Utilization Rewards In Detail

Trading rewards are calculated at the end of the day \(6666 blocks\) weighted by the volume traded of settled options.

## Settling Utilization Rewards in Detail

Settling rewards are issued at the end of the day \(6666 blocks\) weighted by the number of options settled.
