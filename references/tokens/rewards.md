## LP Reward Bonuses

LPs earn rewards based on 3 factors: how much of the pool they've staked, how long they've staked, and how much ETH has been traded while they are staked. 

### Staking Time Bonus ðŸ••

```
(# of days staked)/9 = bonus
```

Every 9 days you remain staked your bonus will grow. For example at 18 days you get 2x, 27 days 3x, 81 days 9x. This bonus is uncapped. It resets anytime you claim rewards or withdraw from the pool.

### Pool Balance Bonus ðŸ’°

```
Any Stake = 2x
Stake > 1% = 3x
Stake > 2% = 4x
Stake > 5% = 6x
Stake > 10% = 8x
Stake > 25% = 14x
Stake > 50% = 20x
```

This bonus is based on how much of the pool you've staked. It's recommended you claim this bonus as soon as you make a large stake as it's calculated at time of reward claim so if your stake is diluted by other stakers over time you'll get less.

### Option Value Bonus ðŸ”ƒ

```
(ETH interchanged)/1 ETH = bonus
```
Every time at least 1 ETH of value is interchanged through the pool you are staked in you will get a bonus. For example if 2 ETH is used in bets you get 2x bonus, 10 ETH is used 10x bonus. This resets anytime you claim rewards or withdraw from the pool.
