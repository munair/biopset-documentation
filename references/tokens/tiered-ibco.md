# Tiered IBCO

The Tiered Initial Bonding Curve Offering, for short TIBCO, is the initial distribution method of the BIOP token.
It's main purpose is to raise funds to pay for initial deployment and to provide a bootstrap to the protocol liquidity.

## Pricing tiers

The TIBCO is comprised of 6 different price tiers that the coins can be traded at.

| Tier | Available BIOP | ETH price |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 450'000 | 0.000035 |
| 2 | 550'000 | 0.00004 |
| 3 | 750'000 | 0.000045 |
| 4 | 1'050'000 | 0.00005 |
| 5 | 1'400'000 | 0.000055 |
| 6 | 1'800'000 | 0.00006 |

Every tier will last 12 hours and its price will be higher than the previous one.
After 12 hours from the start of a tier the remaining coins in the tier are burned.

## Use of raised funds

The first 50 Ethereum raised will go to the treasury to be used for:
  - Smart contract deployment
  - Audits
  - Hosting
  - Advertisment

Of the remaining Ethereum:
  - 50% (up to a maximum of 75 ETH) will be added to a Uniswap Liquidity pool
  - The rest will be added to BIOPset Option liquidty Pool and the bETH tokens locked
